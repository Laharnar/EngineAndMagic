= A* pathfind =
wp grid, with disabled areas where collisions are
automatic ping pong with path for 1 npc, between 2 points
apply A* over those 2 points.
- problems with null values, try to run it as ping pong without A*.

added new character, blue kid with few wave and idle animation.

tried to do talking, but it kinda failed.

notes for todo combat: 
on click 
> player: attack with normal attack combo with 2 secs exit time loop of 2 hits. (they should have different collisions, and animations)
> WeaponUser.cs: has behaviour per weapon type, activate collision checking on weapon. start counting time. time > 2 secs ? reset static attack counter, you dont need 1 for every combo.
> weapon: on trigger deal dmg
> other: handle death > add a brick wall to hit. add canvas based hp bar on brick wall.

= TELEPORTING SUPPORT =
on triggered by function, teleport the target to set location. triggered can be by anything, like collision,
and teleported is to vector, so it can be teleported to object.
its implemented with static data class and trigger mono's

= Done = 
don't want it, next(1): add instant auto trigger options, so you don't need to press e. -
partialy done, dont need to complicate it more, next(2): implement n-sided enter-exit building teleport. teleport can be connect to n connections,
that can chose with string, for ui-choice versions. for now just make it work for 2 sides,
enter and exit building.
