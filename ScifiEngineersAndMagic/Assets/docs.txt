Define the scope properly.
First person gameplay with melle attacks of high strength, with mechanical scarf.
Enemies area also powerful, so humans fly around when hit by them.
They on the other hand can fly around when hit by your sis.

Barricades. Your job is to stand on wall and protect it. You can exit the wall.
Gameplay is rpg-beat-up like.


Prologue:
Skellies came from the other world. Alien contacts embassy tried to handle them and 
everthing went fine for a while. Skellies took it easy, as they were to scout the area
before others come. Humans seemed weak to them, but familiar to their own race, 
yet way more advanced in certain aspects, and idiotic in others, like net. 

But the curse they brought with them, which makes humans
instantly change into immortal skelletons after death, began affecting some people.
Skellies got qurantined against their will, and they fought out. They decided to 
quickly report back. The decision fell to overthrow these humans.
Whole army comes out. Battle ensues with gangs, police, and private military group. 
Galactic goverment ignores it and lets the locals take care of it. It's busy 
fighting on other fronts. They will nuke the skellies if things get out of hand.

for evacuation.

ships were taken.
